# Project Herta Backend (libherta)
This is the repository for backend code (i.e. calculations, url manipulation, etc)

If you're looking for Project Herta, its repository is [herta-bin](https://github.com/Kiwifuit/herta-bin)

There are hopes to compile this project for android apps, but there is a long way until then.
